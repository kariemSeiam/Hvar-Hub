description: Temporary test and debug file isolation with auto-cleanup
globs: ["**/*"]
alwaysApply: true

- Isolation
  - Place any temporary tests or debug scripts in top-level directories:
    - `/temp-tests/` for throwaway tests (frontend or backend).
    - `/debug-scripts/` for ad-hoc scripts.
  - Never put these files under `back/` or `front/` main source trees.

- Conventions
  - Name files clearly, e.g., `temp-tests/backend/test_orders_flow.py`, `temp-tests/frontend/TestOrdersList.jsx`.
  - Avoid importing temp modules from production code. Keep them self-contained.

- Cleanup
  - After resolving the issue, delete the entire directories:
    - Windows: `rmdir /S /Q temp-tests` and `rmdir /S /Q debug-scripts`.
    - Unix: `rm -rf temp-tests debug-scripts`.

- Non-intrusive
  - Do not alter configs to include these directories in builds or content globs. Ensure linters/builds ignore them if needed.

These rules enable safe experimentation without polluting the main codebase.
